but so, if you are awake, i want to ask you: Can you please make a dontation?
DLib and all official addons on top of it are Donationware!
Just a bit of donation! Even if you can only give 1$ or 1â‚¬, thats great if you would ask! Just imagine:
If everyone who is subscribed to my addons will donate money for a cup of tea it will be enough to cover
all my parent's credits. It could also help a lot to my mother who spend entire days on her job.
Currently, the only thing i do is developing these free addons just for you!
Just for community! For free and it is even open source with easy way of contribution! If you could just
make a small donation you will support next addons:
DLib%s]]
